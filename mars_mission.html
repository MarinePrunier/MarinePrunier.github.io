<h1> Mars Analog Mission </h1>

<p>

Wtih a group of seven students I have prepared and participated 
in a Martian analogue mission at the Mars Desert Research Station (MDRS) 
in the desert of Utah (United-States). 
From the 20th of February 2022 to the 12th of March 2022 we have simulated
 crewed martian exploration missions.

</p>
<p>
The aim of this mission is twofold. 
Firstly, to study and understand the challenges and constraints of future manned flights 
and missions to the Moon or Mars. To achieve this, our days are governed by a very strict schedule: 
daily sports sessions, outings in spacesuits... The task that occupies most of our days is to carry 
out scientific experiments related to space exploration and confinement.

<h2> Geology field campaign with LIBS </h2>
This unique experiment aim to explore the field around the MDRS. 
We use a laser induced breakdown spectroscopy instrument, LIBS, allowing, by shooting on a 
rock with a laser, to analyze the spectrum of light emitted by the plasma created with 
the laser impact and determine the composition of a rock .
It is on this principle that one of the 5 instruments present on the 
SuperCam instrument of the rover Perseverance functions and allows to analyze the Martian geology.
For this experiment we had the great opportunity to work with Dr. Rapin,
researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics and Planetology (IRAP Toulouse), 
Pr.Bousquet of the University of Bordeaux and Cécile Fabre from the laboratory GeoRessources and supported 
by SciAps with their Z-903 handheld LIBS analyzer.

<h2> Augmented Reality </h2>
The analog astronauts tested an Augmented Reality application developed
with the aim of providing support during the Extra-Vehicular Activities. 
Mounted on Microsoft HoloLenses, which act as a Heads-Up Display during the EVAS, 
the application allows the analog astronauts to take pictures and identify 
the correct sample collection placement. Furthermore, 
it allows flags to be placed during the EVA, to optimize 
the route back to base, saving some precious time.

<h3>Education and outreach around human space exploration and Mars</h3>
<p>
A Martian analogue mission at the MDRS, because of its completeness in 
terms of accurate simulation and experiments performed, is the perfect set-up to 
introduce young students to human space exploration.
In the context of our mission, we have organised a program of space educational 
activities for middle and high school 
students surrounding the topics of altered gravity, astronomy, health and safety
procedures and robotic systems. Precisely, a set of four experiments that will be 
performed by the students was conceived to bring into light the various scientific 
topics surrounding space exploration missions.

<h3>Crew Member</h3>
<p>
Each crew member (astronomer, botanist, biologist, journalist, safety officer and engineer)
 has a precise role to play in the life of the station.
 As mission astronomer, I supervise the station's three telescopes.
 My first task is to monitor solar activity by studying the appearance of sunspots, 
 which could indicate an imminent solar storm, endangering our martionauts who would
then be exposed to high levels of radiation. 
 My other missions involve observing the sky using a Celestron 14 telescope to search 
 for specific astronomical phenomena. With this telescope, my project was to
  detect an exoplanet passing in front of its star.
 Finally, the station's last telescope enables me to take magnificent photos of
  the deep sky and deliver beautiful images of our favorite nebulae and galaxies.
