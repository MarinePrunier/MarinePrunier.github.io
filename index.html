Hi, I am Marine, a doctoral student in astrophysics at the University of Montreal.<br> 
My research focuses on the study of high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). 
These are the most powerful recurrent light sources in the Universe, 
sometimes emitting spectacular plasma jets, known as radio galaxies. 
I am investigating the influence of these AGNs on the overall dynamics and structure 
of the surrounding galaxy cluster. I am conducting a comparative analysis of the observational 
signature of AGN feedback with the Illustris-TNG cosmological simulations.

<p>
My academic career has taken me to various universities in Switzerland, 
Belgium, France and Canada, where I had the opportunity to work on several research 
topics in astrophysics but also in aerospace engineering and planetary sciences. 
I am also a passionate sky-watcher and have had several experiences as an astronomer along the way!<br>
For more information on my present and past research projects, please check out the <strong> <a href="research"style="color: darkgreen ; text-decoration: none;">RESEARCH</a> </strong> and <strong> <a href="mars_mission" style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;">MARS MISSION</a></strong> tabs.
</p>

<p>
Beyond research, I have consistently dedicated efforts to communicate science to the general public and advocate for the inclusion of women in science. 
For years, I have been engaged in youth outreach through Space@yourservice in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, promoting space science for all, and with Club Mars in Toulouse, a Red Planet-focused science popularization association. 
I am also co-organiser of Astronomy on Tap in Montreal, with regular monthly events in bars around the city.<br>
