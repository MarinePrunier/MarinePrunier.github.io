Hi, I'm Marine, a first year as a doctoral student in astrophysics at the University of Montreal. 
My research is centered around understanding the feedback of active galactic nuclei (AGN) on galaxy clusters. 
Under the guidance of Prof. Hlavacek-Larrondo, a specialist in AGN feedback in galaxy clusters, and Dr. Annalisa Pillepich at the Max Planck Institute in Heidelberg (Co-PI of TNG-Cluster),  I am conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of the observational signature of AGN feedback on galaxy clusters using the TNG-Cluster cosmological simulation (Illustris TNG).

I'm interested in very different reasearch topics in astrophysic but also in aerospace engineering 
My academic journey has taken me to various European universities in Switzerland, Belgium, France, and now Canada.
For more information on these projects, please check out the <a href="research">RESEARCH</a> tab.

<p>
Beyond research, I have consistently dedicated efforts to communicate science to the general public 
and advocate for the inclusion of women in science. Go check the <a href="outreach">OUTREACH</a> tab.
