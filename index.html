Hi, I'm Marine, a doctoral student in astrophysics at the University of Montreal. 
My research focuses on the study of high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs). 
These are the most powerful recurrent light sources in the Universe, 
sometimes emitting spectacular plasma jets, known as radio galaxies. 
I'm investigating the influence of these AGNs on the overall dynamics and structure 
of the surrounding galaxy cluster by conducting a comparative analysis of the observational 
signature of AGN feedback with the Illustris-TNG cosmological simulations.

<p>
My academic career has taken me to various European universities in Switzerland, 
Belgium, France and now Canada, where I had the oppurtunity to work on very different reasearch 
topics in astrophysics but also in aerospace engineering and planetary science. 
I'm also a passionate sky-watcher and have had several experiences as an astronomer along the way!<br>
For more information on my present and past research projects, please check out the <strong><a href="research"style="color: darkgreen ; text-decoration: none;">RESEARCH</a> tab and <a href="mars_mission" style="color: brown; text-decoration: none;">MARS MISSION</a></strong>.
</p>

<p>
Beyond research, I have consistently dedicated efforts to communicate science to the general public 
and advocate for the inclusion of women in science. 
For years, I've been engaged in youth outreach through Space@yourservice in Lausanne, 
Switzerland, promoting space science for all, and with Club Mars in Toulouse, a Red Planet-focused science popularization association. I'm also co-organizer of Astronomy on Tap events in Montreal, with regular monthly events in bars around the city!<br>
