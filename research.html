    <h3> Feedback from Active Galaxy Nuclei (AGN) in Galaxy Clusters Galaxies: a comparative analysis between Observations and Cosmological Simulations </h3>
    <p><strong>Université de Montréal (UdeM)/ Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA) </strong> | 2023 - now |</p>
    <p> With Prof. Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo (UdeM) and Dr. Annalisa Pillepich (MPIA).</p>
    <p> 
        My thesis project aims to explore in depth the effect of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on 
        galaxy clusters. This research is part of our understanding 
        of the evolutionary mechanisms of galaxy clusters, a fundamental field of astrophysics and cosmology.

        </p>
        Located in the central galaxy of a cluster, an active galactic nucleus is one of the most energetic objects in the universe. 
        It influences the overall dynamics and structure of the surrounding galaxy cluster through AGN feedback,
        one of the most remarkable manifestations of which is the creation of gigantic X-ray emitting cavities 
        in the intracluster medium. The study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is an active research topic,
         involving both observations and simulations, with cosmological simulations
        such as IllustrisTNG being powerful tools for improving our understanding of these phenomena.
        <p>
        </p>
        My thesis project aims to study the complex mechanisms governing the evolution of galaxy clusters and
         to determine whether the AGN feedback models implemented in the IllustrisTNG simulations
        are in agreement with actual observations of galaxy clusters.

    <h3>Subsolar Black Hole Hunt in the LIGO-Virgo 3rd Observation Run</h3>
    <p><strong>Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)</strong> | March 2023 - June 2023 | Bruxelles, Belgium</p>
    <p>With Prof. Sébastien Clesse (LIGO-Virgo collaboration), at the Theoretical Physics department of ULB.</p>
    <p>Analysis and parameter estimation of three subsolar black hole candidates in LIGO-Virgo 3rd run data.</p>
    <p> The search for subsolar black holes is an exciting topic for the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, 
    as the detection of such objects would provide evidence for the existence of primordial 
    black holes. We have performed a complete study of a subsolar black hole candidate
     identified in the second part of the third observing run of the gravitational wave detector of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.
