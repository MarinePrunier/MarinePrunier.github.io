    <h3> Feedback from Active Galaxy Nuclei (AGN) in Galaxy Clusters Galaxies: a comparative analysis between Observations and Cosmological Simulations </h3>
    <p><strong>Université de Montréal (UdeM)/ Max Planck Institute Heidelberg (MPIA) </strong> | 2023 - now |</p>
    <p> With Prof. Julie Hlavacek-Larrondo (UdeM) and Dr. Annalisa Pillepich (MPIA).</p>
    <p> 
        My thesis project aims to explore in depth the effect of feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) on 
        galaxy clusters. This research is part of our understanding 
        of the evolutionary mechanisms of galaxy clusters, a fundamental field of astrophysics and cosmology. 
        <p>
        </p>
        Located in the central galaxy of a cluster, an active galactic nucleus is one of the most energetic objects in the universe. 
        It influences the overall dynamics and structure of the surrounding galaxy cluster through AGN feedback,
        one of the most remarkable manifestations of which is the creation of gigantic X-ray emitting cavities 
        in the intracluster medium. The study of AGNs is an active research topic, and the scientific community 
        has yet to elucidate all aspects of their operation. In this context, cosmological simulations such as 
        IllustrisTNG are powerful tools for understanding them.
        <p>
        </p>
        My thesis project aims to study the complex mechanisms governing the evolution of galaxy clusters and
         to determine whether the AGN feedback models implemented in the IllustrisTNG simulations
        are in agreement with actual observations of galaxy clusters.
        This project paves the way for a better understanding of the general evolution of galaxy clusters,
         as well as improving state-of-the-art numerical models,
        and will have significant implications for 
        future cosmological simulations.

		<td> The search for subsolar black holes is an exciting topic for the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, 
            as the detection of such objects would provide evidence for the existence of primordial 
            black holes. In this paper we perform a follow-up of a subsolar black hole candidate
             identified in the second part of the third observing run of the
              gravitational wave detector of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.
